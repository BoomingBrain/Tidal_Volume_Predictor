This is a simple model for predicting Tidal volume of lungs of human on the basis of age height weight smoke or not and having a lung disease or not.
First thing of making a model is to find the dataset. For this type of problem, the dataset is not very extensively available on the internet.
I have used a dataset "tidalfnal.csv" which is attached here. This file contains data of tidal volume of different people based on age height weight smoke and lung disease

MAKING OF MODEL FROM SCRATCH

anylysis of data is done to determine the relation between different parameter with the tidal volume and to determine which model fits best.
In my model I have build the model from basics. My model concept is of Linear regression.
the equation of best fit line comes:- f(x)=w1*Age+w2*weight+w3*height+w4*smoke+w5*lung disease+w6*gender
the input data feeded in the model for training is scaled data to avoid missmatch of range of different column
for feature scaling mean and standard deviation method is used:- (x-mean)/standard devistion
dataset is splited into 3sets train, test, validation
model is trained on train set, loss is recorded on validation set, then final performance is tested on test set
for making the model gradient decent model is used which is build from scratch without using any precoded black box like scikit learn.
appropriate alpha and iteration is used to get minimum loss.
To improve the accuracy in minimum resources appropriate alpha which is not too large and not too small.
for deployement of the model Gradio is used to make a web interface which makes easier for the user to interact with the model

WEIGHT OF THE PARAMETERS USED IN MODEL AFTER TRAINING
[-14.42290671-  13.9059368   20.50251955  -7.11183283  51.03988469 -8.24124183]
['Age','Height (cm)','Weight (kg)','Smoker_code','Gender_codes','disease'] respectively

HOW TO RUN THE CODE
Open the ipynb file in colab and connect the runtime  and just click on run all cell in the runtime tab. all process will be excuted within one minute
at last cell a gradio link is generated where user can interact with the model.(note link is temporary and expire soon, please rerun the code to get the new link)

This model is tested on real life parameters and how actually they affect the tidal volume of a human. This model can be improvedwith more dataset.
